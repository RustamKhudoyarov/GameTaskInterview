Create an abstract Character Class:
        - create a private variable NAME with String type.
        - create a protected variable MAX_HEALTH with int type, default it to 10.
        - create a protected variable HEALTH with int type, default it to MAX_HEALTH.
        - create a constructor that takes in a String as a parameter and assign it to NAME.
        - create getters/setters for NAME.
        - create a public abstract method named examine.

        Create a Warrior class that inherits Character Class:
        - create a private variable STRENGTH with int type.
        - create 2 constructors:
        - Default constructor that sets the name to "Vannaka"
        - A constructor that takes in 3 parameters:
        - NAME as type String and assign it to NAME
        - HEALTH as type int and assign it to HEALTH.
        - STRENGTH as type int and assign it to STRENGTH.

        - create 2 methods:
        - create a public void heal method that takes in an int parameter named hpHealed
        - add hpHealed to HEALTH
        - create a public void takeDamage method that takes in an int parameter named dmgTaken
        - subtract dmgTaken from HEALTH

        - Implement examine method to print out "My name is [NAME]":
        - NAME should be the character's NAME variable

        Create a Game Class:
        - create a main method:
        - Instantiate a Warrior class with a name, health set at 100 and strength set at 50
        - Have the warrior take 99 damage
        - Have the warrior heal 20 health
